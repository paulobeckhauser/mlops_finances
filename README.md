### Question 3
> **A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework**
> **did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:
For our project we used TorchMetrics, whicg can ensure reliable monitoring and comparison of your model's performance, such as accuracy metric, across experiments.
We tried to use the third-party framework PyTorch Forecasting in our project, but couldn't implemented in the correct way, since some data preprocessing is necessary. So it is in the backlog list to be implemented.  PyTorch Forecasting helps in handling the time-series forecasting aspect of our work, which involved predicting the parity price of USD/CHF combined with economic calendar data. It provides powerful tools such as the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, which performs well in capturing relationships across time-varying covariates and static features.
We also implemented Black, which is an open-source tool to automate the process of following the best coding practices(e.g. pep8) in the python code.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

Initially, we used Conda for managing system-level dependencies and ensuring compatibility across different platforms, particularly for libraries requiring specific configurations, such as black for formatting. But then we also created a virtual environment using .venv to isolate project-specific Python dependencies. A member of the team also used 'uv' package manager which is built in Rust, and helps to guarantee compatibility between all the libraries versions, and has great results regarding the installation time comparing to only 'pip install...'.

The process would be: 1. Install python; 2. Clone the repository with 'git clone <repository-url> ; 3. Create a virtual environment with 'python -m venv .venv'; 4. Activate virtual environment with 'source .venv/bin/activate' in a linux/macOS environment; 5. Install dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

*From the cookiecutter template, we have filled out the data, dockerfiles, models, src, and test folders. The data folder was used to organize our raw and processed datasets, ensuring a structured workflow. The dockerfiles folder allowed us to set up a reproducible environment for our project using Docker, making collaboration and deployment seamless. The models folder stored our trained models and associated metadata. The src folder contained all the source code, including preprocessing scripts, model training, and evaluation pipelines. Finally, the test folder was used to ensure our code's functionality through unit and integration tests.

We debated removing the notebooks folder since we rarely used Jupyter notebooks during the project, opting for .py files for prototyping and development to maintain a consistent coding style. Additionally, we added checkpoints and logs folders. The checkpoints folder stored intermediate training states, which allowed us to resume training efficiently, while the logs folder contained experiment details, including training metrics and configurations, making it easier to monitor and reproduce results. These additions were critical for managing and tracking our experiments systematically.*

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We implemented several rules to ensure code quality and consistency. First, we adhered to the PEP 8 guidelines, which define best practices for Python code formatting, including indentation, naming conventions, and spacing. To automate this process, we used the Black library, which enforces a consistent code style by reformatting our code automatically. This helped us maintain a clean and standardized codebase, reducing potential errors caused by inconsistent formatting.

We used docstrings to describe functions, classes, and modules, detailing their purpose, parameters, and expected behavior. This practice was good for team collaboration and onboarding, as it allowed new contributors to understand the code quickly.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In total, we have implemented 4 tests. The first test verifies the raw data, ensuring there are exactly two non-empty files. The second test focuses on preprocessing, validating that the data transformations work as expected. The third test evaluates the model, testing its initialization, forward pass, and training functionality. Finally, the fourth test targets the API, ensuring it handles requests and returns responses correctly. These tests cover the most critical parts of the application: data integrity, preprocessing, model performance, and API functionality.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

The total code coverage of our code is currently 23%, which includes all our source code. This number indicates that we are far from achieving 100% coverage, highlighting areas of the code that are not yet tested. Increasing test coverage is on our to-do list, as it is essential for improving the reliability and robustness of our application.

However, even with 100% code coverage, we would not fully trust the code to be error-free. Code coverage only ensures that the lines of code are executed during testing, but it does not guarantee the correctness of the logic or handle all edge cases. Tests might miss certain scenarios, or the logic might fail under specific conditions. Therefore, while striving for high coverage is important, the quality and thoroughness of the tests, combined with other strategies like code reviews and performance testing, are crucial for ensuring a robust and error-free application.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

* We made extensive use of branches and pull requests (PRs) in our project to streamline collaboration and maintain code quality. We implemented a rule to protect the main branch, requiring that any code merged into it be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. This ensured that only thoroughly reviewed and tested code made its way into the main branch.

Each team member worked on their own branch, typically named based on the specific feature or bug fix being implemented. This approach kept individual contributions isolated, reducing the risk of conflicts and enabling parallel development. When a feature or fix was ready, the contributor merged their branch with their local main branch to verify compatibility. Afterward, they pushed the changes to a remote branch and created a pull request (PR). The PR served as a platform for discussions, comments, and code reviews.

This workflow improved version control by providing a clear history of changes, encouraging collaboration, and minimizing the risk of introducing bugs into the main branch. It also facilitated accountability and knowledge sharing among team members, making the development process more efficient and reliable.*

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

We did not use DVC in our project, but there are many scenarios where having version control of data would be highly beneficial. For example, in machine learning projects where datasets evolve over time, DVC can help track changes to the data, such as adding new samples, correcting labels, or preprocessing adjustments. By using DVC, you can maintain a version history of your data, making it easier to roll back to previous versions or analyze the impact of specific changes on model performance.

Another use case is collaborative projects where multiple team members work with the same dataset. DVC allows syncing data across team members without manually sharing large files, ensuring everyone is working with the same version. It also integrates seamlessly with Git, enabling you to version control data alongside your code.

In large-scale projects, reproducibility is a critical factor. DVC stores metadata about which datasets, models, and configurations were used for a specific experiment, ensuring results can be replicated accurately. This makes it an invaluable tool for managing complex data pipelines and improving workflow efficiency in data-driven projects.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

*We have organized our continuous integration (CI) setup into two separate workflows to ensure a modular and efficient pipeline. Each workflow targets a specific task: one for unit testing, one for linting, and one for deployment. This separation of concerns improves maintainability and scalability as our project grows.

For unit testing, we use pytest to validate our code functionality across multiple operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) and Python versions (3.8 to 3.11). This ensures compatibility and robustness in diverse environments. We also implement caching for Python dependencies using GitHub’s actions/cache, which significantly reduces workflow execution time by avoiding redundant installations.

In our linting workflow, we use flake8 to enforce code style and maintain high readability and quality. This step helps catch potential issues early in the development cycle, reducing technical debt over time. This also showed a lot of improvements were needed in our code.

By leveraging caching, running workflows on multiple platforms, and testing against different Python versions, we have created a robust CI pipeline that ensures our code is reliable and production-ready. An example of one of our workflows can be found <[here](https://github.com/paulobeckhauser/mlops_finances/actions/runs/12845256661)>. This setup provides a strong foundation for continuous improvement and rapid iteration in our development process.*

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

*We configured our experiments using Hydra, a powerful library for managing configuration files and command-line arguments. Hydra allows us to structure experiments through YAML-based config files and override parameters dynamically from the command line. We defined our configuration in the files 'config.yaml' and 'deep_learning.yaml' in the folder 'configs'. In order to be able to run an experiment in our project, just need to run the following code, for example: 'python src/finance/main.py model.epochs=30 model.lr=0.001'*

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

We ensured reproducibility of experiments by leveraging Hydra for managing configurations and logging. All experiment parameters are defined in YAML configuration files (config.yaml and model-specific files like deep_learning.yaml), ensuring that no information is hard-coded in the scripts. This allows for easy tracking and replication of experiment settings.

Whenever an experiment is run, Hydra automatically organizes outputs into uniquely named directories based on the configuration and timestamp. These directories store logs, checkpoints, and any generated outputs, ensuring that each run is isolated and fully documented.

To reproduce an experiment, one simply needs to reference the configuration used during the run. Hydra also allows for saving and loading configurations, so experiments can be rerun with the exact same settings by pointing to the relevant configuration file or overriding parameters via the command line.

This approach guarantees that all essential details, from hyperparameters to outputs, are preserved, enabling full reproducibility and traceability of experiments.
